Hi, I am Chris Koon. I am a passionate developer and lifelong learner in Hong Kong.

I am soon-to-be graduate from [HKPolyU]^(Hong Kong Polytechnic University) where I am completing 
[BSc in Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/study/ug-programmes/comp/), 
Additionally, I hold a 
[HD in Software Engineering](https://www.vtc.edu.hk/admission/en/programme/it114105-higher-diploma-in-software-engineering/)
from **HKIVE** obtained through [VTC]^(Vocational Training Council). 

Technology is my driving force.
I thrive on diving into complex problems and crafting innovative solutions through coding
The world of Information Technology excites me  — fast-paced, 
ever-changing, and full of opportunities to learn and make a difference, 
Whether I am building software, experimenting with new tools, 
or staying up-to-date with the latest trends, I am committed to pushing limits and growing my skills.
This space is where I share my journey — my projects, my thoughts, and what I am learning along the way. 
I am excited to bring my energy and ideas to the table, creating solutions that matter in this dynamic field.

 
I also like playing video game, I am passionate about strategic gems like 
[Slay the Spire](https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/) :crossed_swords:
and [Balatro](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/):spades: :hearts: :clubs: :diamonds:,
or causing playful chaos in [Untitled Goose Game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/837470/Untitled_Goose_Game/) :loud_sound: . 
On top of that, I am a huge fan of bullet hell games, dodging insane patterns and chasing that adrenaline rush.
