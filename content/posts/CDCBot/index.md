## What it is

I built a Discord bot called CDC Bot to make server management easier and more fun. The bot helps automate repetitive
tasks and adds some cool interactive commands for users.

I coded it in Python using the Discord.py library. I also added Flask to create simple webhooks so UptimeRobot could
monitor the bot and restart it if it went offline.

The bot was used in some private Discord servers for a while but is now retired. It mainly helped with moderation stuff
and added fun features for users while staying reliably online thanks to uptime monitoring.


## Features

- Moderation tools like user muting, banning, and message clearing to keep the server environment clean and friendly.
- Custom interactive commands to engage users with fun responses or server-specific features.
- Automated notifications and reminders for important server events or announcements.
- Integration with external services through webhooks for enhanced functionality and uptime monitoring.

## My thoughts
Building this Discord bot was a great learning experience for me. 
It was my first dive into Python and working with APIs like Discord.py, 
which taught me a lot about asynchronous programming and event-driven design. 
Figuring out how to integrate Flask for webhooks and UptimeRobot for monitoring was challenging but rewarding.
I enjoyed seeing the bot in action, helping with server moderation and bringing some fun among the friend. 
Will create a new version of the Discord a long with a telegram bot in the future .
