## What is this
This is a Java-based IQ test Android app that I developed as a project for my ITP4501 course.
The app is designed to provide users with a series of numerical reasoning questions and evaluate their performance based on their answers.
The project was completed as part of the ITP4501 course at the **HKIVE**.

## Features
- User-friendly interface for easy navigation.
- Multiple-choice questions with instant feedback.
- Score calculation based on user responses.
- Option to view correct answers for incorrect responses.
- Timer to track the time taken for each question.
- Results summary at the end of the test.
- Database integration using SQLite to store test questions, user scores and test history.
- Scoreboard to track progress over time.
- Bar chart visualization of scores.


## My thoughts
Developing this app was a great learning experience for me.
I learned a lot about Android development, Java programming, and database management.
I also gained valuable insights into user experience design and how to create an engaging app.
Overall, I am proud of the final product and believe it showcases my skills and knowledge in Android development.
