## What is this?
This is my old personal home page, created with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), and hosted on **GitHub Pages**.
It serves as a place for me to showcase my projects and interests with the world.

## Features
- Information about me
- Share my thoughts
- Project showcases
- Links to my social media and other platforms

## My thoughts
This old personal page was made 3 years ago,
and it was made when i was learning **React** and **Bootstrap**,
at that time I was not familiar with web development,
so I used them to create a simple personal page and learn how to use them.
