## What is this?
This is my personal home page, you are visiting, created with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [**LoveIt**](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/loveit/) theme, and hosted on **GitHub Pages**. 
It serves as a place for me to share my thoughts, projects, and interests with the world.

## Features
- Personal blog posts
- Project showcases
- Search functionality
- Links to my social media and other platforms

## My thoughts
My old personal page was made 3 years ago, 
and I think it is time to update it. 
But the old version was hard to maintain, 
so I decided to use **Hugo** and **LoveIt** theme to create a new one, 
which is much easier to manage and customize.
I also want to make it more user-friendly and visually appealing.
So, I hope you will enjoy my new personal home page!
