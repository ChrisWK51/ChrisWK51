## What is this

This project implements a MIPS-based radix converter that converts numbers from Decimal to various bases. 
The converter is developed in MIPS assembly language and executed using QtSpim. 
Completed as part of the **COMP2421** course at the [HKPolyU]^(Hong Kong Polytechnic University).

## Features

- Converts numbers from Decimal to binary, quaternary and octal bases.
- Supports both positive and negative integers.
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully.

## My thoughts
Writing a simple program in assembly was quite a challenge. 
Compared to high-level languages like Java or Python, 
I realize how tricky even basic logic could get in MIPS. 
That said, completing this project was both rewarding and enjoyable.
