## What is this?
This project implements a containerized, event-driven microservices architecture backend RESTful API, 
designed with reference to UberEat API, 
Completed as a group project as part of the **COMP3122** course at the [HKPolyU]^(Hong Kong Polytechnic University).

## Features
- Microservices architecture with event-driven communication
- Docker Compose for container orchestration and deployment
- RESTful API endpoints
- Comprehensive unit testing
- UberEat API-inspired design for scalability and maintainability

## My Thoughts
This project was a great opportunity to learn about microservices architecture and event-driven design patterns.
I enjoyed working with Docker and Flask to create a scalable and maintainable backend API.
The experience of collaborating with a team to build a complex system was invaluable,
and I learned a lot about software development.
